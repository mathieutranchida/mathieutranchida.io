          This shot was a big surprise! We were supposed to shoot another spot
          but the area was closed. Bea spotted this wall and we decided to give
          it a try. I immediately tried to give it a unique perspctive and I
          love the result.

          Shot this on a 70-200mm f/2.8 wide open and there is little to no
          edits made in post. Definitely one of my favorite raw shots from this
          year.
