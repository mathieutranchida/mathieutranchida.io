          Passionnate about new technologies and digital content creation. Iâ€™m a
          young professional ready to put my skills to work. Over the years, I
          have developped strong skills in photography, design, video
          production, and web development. After completing a Full-Stack Web
          Development Diploma, I now have a full-scope understanding of the
          development process, and I am more passionate than ever about frontend
          development.
